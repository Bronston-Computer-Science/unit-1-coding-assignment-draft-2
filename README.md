# Follow these instructions:

## Modify the `ShoppingCart.java` file to:

-  Ask the user to input the total number of items in their cart (minimum 3, maximum 15).
   -  Ensure the inputted number of items is within your specified range.
-  Prompt the user to input the price of each item (in dollars, between $1 and $1000).
   -  Validate the input for each price whiles ensuring that each price inputted is a number between 1 and 1000.
-  Store all the prices within an array, calculate and print:
   -  The total price of all items.
   -  The average price.
   -  The most expensive and the least expensive items.
-  Apply a discount based on the total price:
   -  If the total cost of items is over $500, apply a 10% discount.
   -  Otherwise, no discount.

## Your program output should look like this:

Item 1: Price = $150  
Item 2: Price = $250  
Item 3: Price = $200  
...  
...  
...  
Total Price (before discount) = $600  
Average Price = $200  
Most Expensive Item = $250  
Least Expensive Item = $150  
Discount Applied: 10%  
Final Price = $540
